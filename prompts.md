# Main long prompt to create minecraft world.

I would like to create a "thin" version of the game "minecracft". The goal of the project is to apply Reinforcement Learning algorithm and be a convenient environment to develop new algorithms.

It should have the following in the implementation:
 
1. It should be a 3D world as in the original minecraft. The world structure should  be controlled by a seed. 

2. As in mineraft, we see the POV of a player wandering the world. 

3. In order for it to be 3D, it should be composed of the bricks that composed the world in minecraft. The user can control the player with the keys. 

4. It will have an api so one can algorithmetically control the player.

5. The world should have two types of objects: food and poison. The user goal is to get as much as food as it can and refrain from the poison.
